This is my Worms variation named “Survivors”. I was aiming for “Passing with destinction” during this project, but since I’m sending this in late because of faulty code and the fixes not being structured as well as I would have liked, I understand and hope I can still get Passing.  

 

Features 

 

Scenes and menu 

The game contains two scenes, one being the game and the other being a start menu. From the menu you are able to select to play up to 4 players with 4 survivors each. When pressing start, you are immediately dropped into the game. There is no game over screen because of time constraints. 

 

Players 

When the survivors are created, the players are randomly spawned across the map and each team gets its own team color(pre-selected) that their survivors wear during the course of the game. If a character takes enough damage, their color switch to gray and the system considers them dead.  

Because of the assignment, a jump feature has been added, but with the current map can’t really make use of it. 

 

Turn based Gameplay 

The Turn manager has been the most time-consuming part of the game, and is therefore also the most optimized feature in the game. It is adaptable to how many teams and survivors there are in the game and is also able to tell if a character is dead and will thereafter skip it. 

 

Health system 

Each survivor has its own health pool that tells the turn manager if it’s alive or not. It has more than 1 health point so that the character won’t die imminently and makes you consider which weapon you want to use. 

 

Weapon System 

You can select from two separate weapons: A longer ranged sniper rifle or a burst firing machine gun. The sniper rifles bullets travel far longer than the machine gun and a one bullet from a sniper rifle deals more than a single bullet from a machine gun. But the machine gun fires 3 bullets at once that deal a greater amount of damage in total than the sniper rifle, encouraging the player to get closer to each other for a higher damage payoff.  

The damage has not been able to be adjusted because of time constraint but the principle is that there should be a reward for daring to get in close to your enemy. 

The aiming system had to be cut because of deadline, so the weapons work, but you can’t adjust the height of the gun. 

 

Camera system 

One of the more time-consuming features, but now you can walk in the direction you’re looking and look all around you.
